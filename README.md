## Kali BSPWM auto install

---

Please, upgrade the system before execute the script:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

This autoinstall now only has one theme that is inspired by rei, but for future updates I plan to add more themes.

Some settings were taken from [hack4u](https://hack4u.io) from the [linux customization course](https://hack4u.io/cursos/personalizacion-de-entorno-en-linux/).

This is how BSPWM looks like after installation:
